			<h1>Will's Wire</h1>
			<p>
				My name is Will Walker. As a Software Developer, I specialize in DevOps technologies and currently work 
				for the United States Air Force in delivering capabilities to USCYBERCOM. I push code to public repositories 
				on both GitHub and GitLab, but I'm mostly active in private repos.
			</p>
			<p>
				When I'm not writing code, I enjoy exercising, reading, listening to/playing music, eating good food and drinking great coffee.
